This is a Shopping Cart application built using React and TypeScript. The project demonstrates how to build a fully functional shopping cart where users can add, remove, and adjust the quantity of items in their cart. The cart data is persisted across page reloads using local storage.

Key Features:
- Add/Remove Items: Add products to the cart and remove them.
- Increase/Decrease Quantity: Adjust the quantity of products in the cart.
- Persistence: The shopping cart data is stored in local storage, ensuring it persists across page reloads.
- Dynamic Product Display: Fetch product data from an external API (Unsplash API) to display random products.
- Product Rating

Technologies Used
